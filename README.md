# SQL-Project

## Project Overview

You would have encountered data in CSV or XLSX format throughout this program up till now. But, does your organization keep all of its data in an excel file? The Answer is No. They use databases to store the data. To access the data stored in a database, we use Structured Query Language. We query data across rows and columns to get the desired data. A company will expect you to access the database and do an analysis of the data. 
The primary goal of this course is to make you proficient in querying the data stored in a database using SQL and perform analysis on it.

## Objectives

Understand how the data is stored in a database
Understand different types of SQL statements, Joins, and aggregations
Transform raw data into information that is actionable
Start using MySQL
